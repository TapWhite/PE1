    "Last year, in Experimentele Natuurkunde, you have used the MyDAQ a few times to read out data using a program made by us. It would however be useful if you could get and analyse the data simultaneously using python. Furthermore, the MyDAQ can also be used to generate signals, which we will further refer to as writing data. The MyDAQ is therefore a combination of an oscilloscope with a function generator. Hence, you can use it to automatically evaluate transfer functions of various electronic systems. After this session you will be able to communicate with any apparatus you may encounter in a lab."
