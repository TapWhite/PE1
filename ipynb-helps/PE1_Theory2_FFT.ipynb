    "In the lectures of PE1, you probably heard about the discrete Fourier Transform, with which you can fourier transform a discrete set of points. The problem with this fourier transform, is that the algorithm is computationally expensive for large datasets. Therefore, instead of working with a DFT, we will be using the fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which is an efficient algorithm which approximates the DFT. In the following cells, there will be a short introduction on how to use the FFT."
